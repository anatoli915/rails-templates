My Rails 3 templates.

h3. basic.rb

This is the template I use most of the time. It includes the following features:

* annotate-models plugin. I really like it.
* will_paginate.
* git repository initialization if you want it.

h3. jquery.rb

I use this template when I need to play with jquery, it includes the following
features:

* Application layout created with inclusion of jquery.
* git repository initialization

h3. git.rb

It initialize a new git repository with rails specific actions.
