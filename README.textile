My personal templates, honestly i don't know if you will use them.
I created this project because i wanted to familiarize with github :)
In the following lines you can find a short description of each template.

h3. basic.rb

This is the template i use most of the time. It includes the following features:

* annotate-models plugin. I really like it.
* restful-authentication. It's simple _impossible_ not to use it.
* acts_as_attachment. Generally, my brand-new projects require attachment and so there it is.
* will_paginate. the gem version.
* git repository initalization

h3. jquery.rb

I use this template when i need to play with jquery, it includes the following
features:

* jQuery 1.3.2 installation. Now, i assume that you can run curl. Maybe i will
find a better solution.
* Application layout created with inclusion of jquery.
* git repositiory initialization
