My Rails 3 templates. Please take a look to "http://guides.rubyonrails.org/generators.html#application-templates":this guide to dig into Rails application templates.

In the following a description of the templates you can use:

h3. basic.rb

This is the template I use most of the time. It includes the following features:

* annotate. Come on, you need it.
* kaminari.
* the awesome devise if you want it.
* git repository initialization if you want it.

h3. raw.rb

The same as basic.rb but not polite. It doesn't ask, it installs stuff.

h3. jquery.rb

I use this template when I need to play with jquery, it includes the following features:

* Application layout created with inclusion of jquery.
* git repository initialization

I think I'll delete this one when Rails 3.1 becomes the stable version.

h3. git.rb

It initializes a new git repository with rails specific actions.
