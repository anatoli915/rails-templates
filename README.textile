My Rails 3 templates.

h3. basic.rb

This is the template I use most of the time. It includes the following features:

* annotate.Come on, you need it.
* kaminari.
* the awesome devise if you want it.
* git repository initialization if you want it.

h3. raw.rb

The same as basic.rb but not polite. It doesn't ask, it installs stuff.

h3. jquery.rb

I use this template when I need to play with jquery, it includes the following
features:

* Application layout created with inclusion of jquery.
* git repository initialization

h3. git.rb

It initializes a new git repository with rails specific actions.
